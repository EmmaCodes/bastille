- quote: Bastille Agency took care of me from start to finish. It was great to brush
    up on my tech interviewing skills before actually being in front of a company.
    Once that was done, I got matched with an awesome startup and got a significant
    salary increase . Overall, the experience definitely exceeded my expectations.
