Getting talented people to join your company is not easy, but it’s important. If you have run out of “friends” to recruit, have not seen much success in your job postings, or have had enough with agency recruiter noise, we should talk.

You need to take your recruiting as seriously as you take your finance and marketing. And you probably needed to make more than a few crucial hires yesterday. We can help you with both, as an embedded addition to your company. We’ll get to know your needs, your culture, and your quirks. And we will set up a process to consistently approach, engage, and close top talent.

Need more help? We can dial up resources accordingly. Finished with a hiring spurt? We’ll quiet down until the next one. We can even place and train an internal recruiter who can continue the job once we are done.

Right now our focus is on New York City tech teams, but this could expand in the future.
